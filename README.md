# AES Algorithm

In this project, AES is implemented for deception and encryption.

AES-128 is a block cipher that operates on blocks of 128 bits (16 bytes). This algorithm performs multiple substitutions and permutations in each block, then concatenates it all.

The Rijndael S-Box is used by AES, and since AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, there is a Reverse Rijndael S-Box for decryption.

In the AES, four basic operations are repeated over N rounds. The three operations are ADDING, SUBSTITUTING, SHIFTING, and MIXING.


## Language
